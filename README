NAME
    Dancer::Serializer::JSONPP - Dancer serializer with JSON::PP

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    This class is an interface between Dancer's serializer engine
    abstraction layer and the JSON::PP module.

    In order to use this engine, use the template setting:

        serializer: JSONPP

    This can be done in your config.yml file or directly in your app code
    with the set keyword.

        set serializer => 'JSONPP';

    The JSON::PP module will pass configuration variables straight through.
    Some of these can be useful when debugging/developing your app: pretty
    and canonical, and others useful with ORMs like DBIx::Class:
    allow_blessed and convert_blessed. Please consult the JSON documentation
    for more information and a full list of configuration settings. You can
    add extra settings to the engines configuration to turn these on. For
    example:

        engines:
            JSONPP:
                allow_blessed:   '1'
                canonical:       '1'
                convert_blessed: '1'

    but when you want to do changing configuration like sort_by, try:

        var jsonpp_sort_by => sub { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b };
        { 'a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'aa' => 3, '1' => 4 }; # will output JSON with key ordered as 1, a, aa, b

    all vars started with jsonpp_ will be passed.
